# Price-Check-Games-Discord-Bot
## Summary
The idea is to create a discord bot that has the functionality to scrape several video game websites namely Steam, Epic Games Store, and eBay(for a different type of site). The bot will then return the price at each of these sites for the user along with a synopsis of the game. It will be modeled after another type of bot created by merto-dvp that would take user input for an item from Runescape and return the price from the GE on the mainsite:[Link](https://github.com/merto-dvp/python-rspricebot). If time permit more functionality will be added such as scrapping games from different catagoies and possibly more site such as Playstation and Xbox's stores.
